## Payroll process for Research Commons Graduate Academic Assistants (GAAs):

Below is an outline of the pay process for GAAs associated with the Research Commons. The **important takeaway** is that your role will largely consist of "passive monitoring" of your hours; excluding certain instances (specified below), you will not have to take any action regarding your pay.

1. At the beginning of each week, the Research Commons' Timekeeper enters a predetermined "default" number of hours for each GAA.
    >You should be informed of this number before you begin work. If you have questions, contact your Team Lead.
2. GAAs will notify the Timekeeper, and Cc their respective Team Lead, **only if** the amount of time they work for that week differs (more or less) from the designated default time. In this case, the Timekeeper will update the time in Workday.
    >Deviations in hours worked generally must be approved ahead of time in consultation with your Team Lead.
3. The Research Commons' Manager (Eugene Barsky, or designate) will approve the entered time by the final approval date for the applicable pay period. Any notification of a change in hours after a pay period closes will be compensated for in the following pay period--e.g., A GAA notifies the Timekeeper the day after a pay period closes that they worked more hours the preceding week than their allotted amount. The Timekeeper will then add these additional hours to that GAA's total hours worked for the following pay period.

For information on paydays and pay periods, please refer to the following, taken from <a href="https://finance.ubc.ca/payroll/your-pay">https://finance.ubc.ca/payroll/your-pay</a>.

>All employees at UBC will be paid on the 15th and last day of the month. If you are paid hourly, your payday on the 15th will include hours worked from the 24th day of the previous month to the 8th day of the current month. Your end-of-the-month pay will include hours worked from the 9th to the 23rd of the current month. Paydays falling on holidays or weekends are moved to the preceding non-holiday day.
