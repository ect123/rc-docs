# Research Commons consultations
Summary of themes from discussion at RC GAA Team meeting, Dec 4, 2020. Questions to prompt the discussion:

- What has worked well in your consultations with users?
- What would you like to improve or change?

## Themes

### Clarifying the nature of the consult question in advance

- Helps to clarify exactly the question the client wants to review in advance.
- If anyone needs help setting up a good series of questions on their Consult form so that you have sufficient background info, please ask Eka.
- Clarifying if the client is on PC or MAC before the consult can be critical for certain types of consults.

### Use Remote Desktop (Zoom Feature)

- Many team members are now using the remote desktop feature in Zoom.
- Take control of your client's computer so that you can show them on their computer, in their software what they need to do.
- Remote desktop can prove useful if a language barrier may be involved in the consultation.

### Use the Annotations (Zoom Feature)

- Using the Annotations feature in Zoom is also very useful.

### Have shared resources on the GitHub website

- Having shared code that help illustrate a variety of common questions can be very useful in consults. (R consults for example)
- The teams can create this code and then anyone can use it on the fly in a consult.

### Variation in volume of consults across teams

- Various different teams have varying volumes of consults. 
  - Certain teams are oversubscribed - Citation Management, NVivo, R, and Thesis Formatting.
  - Other groups facilitate learning in the community through other means. For example the GIS team spends most of their hours doing project work because they find this the best use of a very limited amount of hours.
  - Digital Scholarship team offers mostly workshops. Eka gets a lot of consultation-like requests but they are usually big project type questions and it is not possible to parcel out appropriately-sized questions for GAAs. 
  - In all cases more than enough work for GAAs to do without adding consults on top of current workload.
  - Unfortunately we do not have enough bandwidth to offer consults to clients who are not associated with the UBC. To set up your consults so that they are restricted to UBC only clients, please follow Eka's instructions found here:  https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/rc-docs/docs/usingthercspaces/consultsinlibcal.html > specifically: "Consults prioritize members of the UBC community. Under “Enable LibAuth Authentication” select “CWL only” to enforce this. If you have any questions about this policy please discuss it with your team lead."

### Promotion of consults

- Eka adds resources mentioned in workshop to follow-up email. Suggested also adding link to booking consults in case participants want to book to learn more.
- Want to make sure that our promotions don't invite people to come to a consult for something we cover in a workshop.
- Being specific about what we can offer in a consult is important. We are looking for ways to clarify this in the follow-up emails and on the website.
