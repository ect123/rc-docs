# Booking online workshops in LibCal
1. If you are a member of the UBC Library Research Commons team, please set up all your LibCal events by logging into LibCal as research.commons@ubc.ca. If you are on another team but also wish to set up the event from the research.commons@ubc.ca account, please connect with one of the team members for login information.

2. Choose Research Commons Events ONLINE (if your workshop is in a physical room, choose Research Commons Events) template in LibCal.

3. You need select No Location under Event Location. (Note this is temporary solution until the new functionality for Zoom is set up.)

4. For Event Registration, with the Research Commons Events ONLINE template, the default is 80 people with no waiting list. Also, the registration form is automatically selected so that participants can enter their unit and whether they would like to receive our newsletter.

6. You need to update the unique survey link. You start with the base link of <a href="https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0MtLRW33U8lIp8x?title=replacetext&presenter=replacetext&date=2020-12-31" target="_blank">https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0MtLRW33U8lIp8x?title=replacetext&presenter=replacetext&date=2020-12-31</a> but you must make a unique link for your workshop so we can distinguish your survey results from other workshops.  The image below shows you the part you must change to match the details of your workshop.
