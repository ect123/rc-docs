## Do I have to include closed captioning with my workshops?

No but this is a nice way to try to make our workshops more accessible. Additionally, it is very easy to set up and requires very minimal effort on your part once it is set up. Consider speaking slowly and annunciate as much as possible. 

## Free options for captioning at UBC

This information is fortunately quickly evolving, so please email research.commons@ubc.ca if it becomes out-of-date.
